# Hi — I’m Arpita.

My interests lie in building AI systems that work in the real world. On this site, I write about my learnings and perspectives on multimodal foundation model development, LLM-powered systems, AI governance, scaling ML organizations, lessons from taking research to production and leadership judgement in real-world systems.

I’m currently with [Tempus AI](https://www.tempus.com), where I lead development of multimodal Oncology Foundation Models and applied AI systems across clinical and research domains. My current work spans foundation model design, large-scale training infrastructure, evaluation frameworks, and deploying AI in regulated healthcare environments.

Previously, at Google, I worked on Applied ML and ML Platform teams delivering production-grade AI systems across Ads, Safety, and enterprise products at global scale.

Views here are entirely my own and focus on patterns rather than any proprietary details.
